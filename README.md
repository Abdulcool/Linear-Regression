# Linear-Regression

# Linear regression (deep learning)

Linear regression attempts to model the relationship between two variables by fitting a linear equation to observed data. One variable is considered to be an explanatory variable, and the other is considered to be a dependent variable. For example, a modeler might want to relate the weights of individuals to their heights using a linear regression model.

A linear regression line has an equation of the form:
# Y = a + bX,
where X is the explanatory variable and Y is the dependent variable. 
The slope of the line is b, and a is the intercept (the value of y when x = 0).

# We have to predict Salaries on the basis of years of experience.

We are going to train 66% of the salaries and test the remaining 33%.
First we Import the Libraries

Then we load the dataset

There is more of this dataset when you run it. This is just an example of what the labels will look like

Then we decide which columns and rows we shoud choose for X and Y

Now we make the x train x test, y train y test. We will also add linear regression to the dataset.

Now we will visualize the regression on the training set results

Now we will add the regression of the training set on the testing set

Now we will predict the salary for 7 years of experience
